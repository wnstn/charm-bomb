# Hello
## I'm Winston.

<div class="body">

I'm a Front End Developer working remotely for [Vox Media](http://voxmedia.com) in Chattanooga, TN.

Previously, I helped build the [FiftyThree Press Page](http://press.fiftythree.com) , worked as a QA engineer for [Editorially](http://editorially.com) (RIP), and helped launch the fully-responsive, user-friendly 2.0 update to [FoxyCart](http://foxycart.com), all while traveling the country with my wife and son.

I blog at [winstonhearn.com](http://winstonhearn.com), I'm on Github as [wnstn](https://github.com/wnstn/), I tweet at [@suchwinston](https://twitter.com/suchwinston) (be forewarned that I'm obnoxious), and if you need to send me substantial information you can do so <a href="mailto:hello@wnstn.com">via email.</a>
