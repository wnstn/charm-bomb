# Hello
### I'm Winston.

I'm a Front End Developer working remotely for [in Chattanooga, TN](http://voxmedia.com)

Recently, I helped build the [FiftyThree Press Page](http://press.fiftythree.com) , worked as a QA engineer for [Editorially](http://editorially.com) (RIP), and helped launch the fully-responsive, user-friendly 2.0 update to [FoxyCart](http://foxycart.com), all while traveling the country with my wife and son.

I blog at [winstonhearn.com](http://winstonhearn.com), I'm on Github as [wnstn](https://github.com/wnstn/), I tweet at [https://twitter.com/suchwinston](@suchwinston) (but I'm really annoying), and if all else fails you can email me <a href="mailto:hello@wnstn.com">here.</a>
